        <h2>Game Rules</h2>
        Be the first player to reach 100 points to win. Game Start: Players take
        turns rolling a die. Rolling the Die: - A player can roll as many times
        as they want to accumulate points. - Points scored in a turn are added
        to the player's current round score. Outcomes of Rolling: - Rolling a 1:
        The player scores no points for that turn and must pass the die to the
        next player. - Rolling 2-6: The number rolled is added to the player's
        round score. Ending a Turn: - A player can choose to stop rolling at any
        time and add their round points to their total score. - If they choose
        to stop, their turn ends, and the next player rolls. Winning the Game**:
        The game ends when a player reaches 100 points. That player is declared
        the winner. Strategy: Players should weigh the decision of whether to
        roll again or stop to avoid the risk of losing all points for that turn.
