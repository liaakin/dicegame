        <h2>Game Rules</h2>
        <br />
        Game Start: Players take turns rolling a die. <br />
        Rolling the Die:<br />
        - A player can roll as many times as they want to accumulate points.<br />
        - Points scored in a turn are added to the player's current round
        score.<br />
        Outcomes of Rolling:<br />
        - Rolling a 1: The player scores no points for that turn and must pass
        the die to the next player. <br />- Rolling 2-6: The number rolled is
        added to the player's round score.<br />
        Ending a Turn: <br />- A player can choose to stop rolling at any time
        and add their round points to their total score.<br />
        - If they choose to stop, their turn ends, and the next player rolls.<br />
        Winning the Game: The game ends when a player reaches 100 points. That
        player is declared the winner.<br />
        Strategy: Players should weigh the decision of whether to roll again or
        stop to avoid the risk of losing all points for that turn.
